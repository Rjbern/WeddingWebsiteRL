# Firebase Setup Instructions for RSVP Database

## What You Need to Do

Your wedding website now has database functionality! Follow these steps to enable RSVP saving.

### 1. Create Firebase Project
- Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
- Create a new project (name it "Wedding RSVP" or similar)
- Wait for it to initialize

### 2. Set Up Firestore Database
- In Firebase Console, go to "Build" → "Firestore Database"
- Click "Create database"
- Select "Start in production mode"
- Choose your region
- Click "Create"

### 3. Set Firestore Security Rules
- Go to the "Rules" tab in Firestore
- Replace everything with this code:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /rsvps/{document=**} {
      allow create: if true;
      allow read, update, delete: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

- Click "Publish"

### 4. Get Your Firebase Configuration
- Click the gear icon (⚙️) in Firebase Console
- Go to "Project settings"
- Scroll down to "Your apps"
- Copy your web app config (or create a web app if needed)
- You'll see values like: apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.

### 5. Create .env.local File
In the main folder (wwrl), create a new file called `.env.local` and add:

```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
```

Replace each `your_xxx_here` with the actual values from your Firebase config.

### 6. Restart Your App
```
npm start
```

Done! RSVPs will now save to your Firebase database.

## How to View RSVPs

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Firestore Database"
